# Data Exploration and Analysis - Assignment

In this assignment, you will repeat the steps you followed in the tutorial using a different dataset of your choice. This will help reinforce your understanding of data exploration, correlation analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Instructions:

1. **Choose a New Dataset**:
   - Select a new dataset from any source (such as `sklearn` or Kaggle). You may choose a dataset that is related to a field of interest.

2. **Follow the Tutorial Steps**:
   - Revisit the steps you completed in the tutorial: 
     - Load and inspect the data.
     - Select features for analysis.
     - Create histograms and scatter plots.
     - Save and analyze a correlation plot.
   
3. **Upload the Results to GitHub**:
   - **Save the Figure**: After completing the analysis, download the correlation plot figure from your notebook or Colab.
   - **Add the Figure to GitHub**: Upload the figure to GitHub using the "Add file" option.
   - **Add Your Analysis**: Write your analysis in a `analysis.txt` file (or as a markdown file), describing the correlation you observed, and save it in this GitHub repository.
   - **Add Your Code**: Save your code as a Python script (`main.py`) in this GitHub repository.

4. **Submit**:
   - Ensure your GitHub repository contains:
     - The correlation plot figure.
     - The analysis text file with your observations.
     - The Python script (`main.py`) containing your code.

Good luck, and be sure to provide clear insights from your analysis!
