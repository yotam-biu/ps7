# Data Exploration and Analysis — Assignment

In this assignment, you will repeat the steps you followed in the tutorial using **a new dataset of your choice**. This will help reinforce your understanding of data exploration, correlation analysis, and visualization techniques.

> **Note**  
> **This week you do *not* need to get a green ✓ mark in GitHub Classroom.**  
> Simply make sure the required files are uploaded to your repository.

## 1. Choose a New Dataset
Select a new dataset from any source (e.g., `sklearn`, Kaggle, or any open dataset).  
You may choose a dataset related to a field that interests you.

---

## 2. Repeat the Tutorial Steps
Follow the steps you practiced in class:

- Load and inspect the data  
- Select several features  
- Create **histograms**  
- Create **scatter plots**  
- Compute a **correlation matrix**  
- Generate and save a **correlation plot** (heatmap or similar)

---

## 3. Upload Your Results to GitHub
Your repository must include:

1. **Correlation plot figure**  
2. **Analysis file** (`analysis.txt` or `analysis.md`)  
   - Write 1–2 paragraphs describing the correlations you observed  
3. **Python script** named `main.py` containing your code

Upload files using **“Add file → Upload files”** on GitHub.

## 4. (Optional but Recommended) Use AI to Improve Your Visualization

You are encouraged to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) to **improve your figure** by generating enhanced plotting code.

Example improvements you can ask AI to help you with:

- Use a cleaner or more readable **color palette**  
- Add **correlation value labels** inside the heatmap  
- Improve **font sizes**, spacing, or layout  
- Create **scatter plots with regression lines**  
- Design a custom **matplotlib style** for consistent aesthetics  

(*You only need one improvement — the purpose is to practice using AI as a coding assistant.*)

---

## Submission Checklist

Your GitHub repository must contain:

- ✔ `main.py`  
- ✔ `analysis.txt` (or `.md`)  
- ✔ Correlation plot figure (e.g., `correlation.png`)

No automated checks are required this week.

Good luck, and make sure your analysis is clear and well-explained!
