# Data Exploration and Analysis — Assignment

In this assignment, you will repeat the steps you followed in the tutorial using **a new dataset of your choice**. This will help reinforce your understanding of data exploration, correlation analysis, and visualization techniques.

> **Note**  
> **This week you do *not* need to get a green ✓ mark in GitHub Classroom.**  
> Simply make sure the required files are uploaded to your repository.

---

## 1. Choose a New Dataset
Select a new dataset from any source (e.g., `sklearn`, Kaggle, or any open dataset).  
You may choose a dataset related to a field that interests you.

---

## 2. Repeat the Tutorial Steps
Follow the steps you practiced in class:

- Load and inspect the data  
- Select several features  
- Create **histograms**  
- Create **scatter plots**   
- Generate and save a **correlation scatter plot**

---

## 3. Upload Your Results to GitHub
- Save the Figure: After completing the analysis, download the correlation plot figure from your notebook or Colab.
- Add the Figure to GitHub: Upload the figure to GitHub using the "Add file" option.
- Add Your Analysis: Write your analysis in a analysis.txt file (or as a markdown file), describing the correlation you observed, and save it in this GitHub repository.
- Add Your Code: Save your code as a Python script (main.py) in this GitHub repository.

## 4. (Optional but Recommended) Use AI to Improve Your Visualization

You are encouraged to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) to **improve your figure** by generating enhanced plotting code.

### Example improvements you can ask AI to help you with:

- Improve **font sizes**, spacing, or layout for readability  
- Create **scatter plots with regression lines**  
- Design a custom **matplotlib style** for consistent aesthetics  
- Use **interactive platforms** such as *Plotly*  
- Use **nicer visual styles** such as *Seaborn*  
- Create **additional useful plots**, such as:  
  - density plots  
  - pairplots  
  - violin plots  
  - boxplots  
  - distribution comparisons  
  - or any other visualization that adds insight  

(*You only need one improvement — the purpose is to practice using AI as a coding assistant.*)

## Submission Checklist

Your GitHub repository must contain:

- ✔ `main.py`  
- ✔ `analysis.txt` (or `.md`)  
- ✔ Correlation scatter plot figure (e.g., `correlation.png`)

No automated checks are required this week.

Good luck, and make sure your analysis is clear and well-explained!
